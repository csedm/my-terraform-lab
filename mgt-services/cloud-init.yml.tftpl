#cloud-config
# This is a custom cloud-init template specific to our Alpine images customized by our Packer template.
# The user: override does not work on alpine, so we customized it at the Packer level.
# Options must be set here in cloud-init a particular way to get the expected behavior.
#
# 1. - default should not be specified, as it would create the alpine user, which we don't want. 
# 2. For users:, we must specify our customized default user setup by our packer template.
#    The default user must include the lock_passwd: false and passwd: "*" to ensure the user is not locked after cloud-init runs.
# 3. Additional users can be specified as needed with no impact, however all must have the same two options in order for ssh login to work.
